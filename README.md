# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

This project aims to forecast the demand for bike rentals in a city's bike-sharing system based on historical usage patterns and weather data. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the total number of bikes rented during each hour, considering various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal patterns.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:
   - `data_exploration.ipynb`: Explore and visualize the dataset.
   - `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
   - `model_training.ipynb`: Train and evaluate machine learning models for demand prediction.

Note: Make sure to update the file paths in the Notebooks according to your local setup.
